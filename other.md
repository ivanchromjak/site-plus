Perhaps we can help you in your time of need. We are a Non-denominational ordained ministers willing to help you.
 
Have you ever experience frustration with a particular church and or denomination because you needed a service they weren't willing to perform? Do you need a place for your small wedding or commitment service? Our Chapel will hold 20 people or less, and you can decorate it.  Why go to City Hall, when you can have your own private space for your ceremony?
Know that I have! I have experience the anguish of a family member trying to find a pastor that was willing to officiate a funeral of someone who wasn't a member of his/her church. Often when you are able to find a Pastor to officiate the funeral they may not allow it in their church, and then this family is force to find a place for the service. i.e. the funeral or a graveside service.

According to Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition. The term minister is 2a. one officiating or assisting the officiant in church worship.
The term ministering is 2. to give aid or service <~to the sick>. The term mission is 2a. a ministry commissioned by a religious organization to propagate its faith or carry on humanitarian work. I feel that I was called into the Ministry to Minister in Mission to the people that do not have a church home or affiliation for "whatever" reason. It is the later reason is why I am non-denominational, and wanted to be ordained as such. I am so blessed to be in my 11th year ministering one of the tiers of our outreach ministries.

One2One Educational Outreach Programs. I Praise the God of my understanding for allowing us to have a relationship with him/her, and allowing to us an opportunity to minister to people according to their needs. Learn more about our ministry in weeks to come, including about my assistant bishop in Chicago, IL. If "your" God has been good to you, then Praise Him/Her Right Now!
